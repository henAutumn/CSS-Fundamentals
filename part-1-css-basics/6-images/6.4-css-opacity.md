# 6.4: Opacity

The `opacity` property changes the image from fully opaque to fully transparent. The range goes from 0 to 1 \(0 is transparent; 1 is opaque\).

## Implementation

Create your two `HTML` and `CSS` files and copy/paste the content from the last lesson into your respective locations. Now, add a `opacity` of `0.5`:  


```css
body {
  background: cornflowerblue;
}
#picture {
  height: 98vh;
  width: 98vw;
  object-fit: cover;
  opacity: 1;
}
```

If you run your code, you should see this:

Change the value of `opacity` to `0.5`.

You should now see this:

![](../../.gitbook/assets/6.4.02.png)

Change the value of `opacity` to `0`.

You should now see this:
