# 6.2: Object Fit

If we remember all the way back to `background-size` \(2.3\), we were able to set a particular size for our background image. `Object-fit` is very similar to this property in that we are able to adjust the size of the image we use, in particular, to prevent squishing/stretching of the picture we use.

## Object-Fit Options

However, unlike `background-size`, `object-fit` only takes specific values, rather than numeric or percentage, etc.  


| Object-Fit Values | Descriptions |
| :--- | :--- |
| fill | Content is set to fill the container; if necessary it will be stretched/squished to fill \(**this is the default**\) |
| container | Content is scaled to fit inside the container while keeping the aspect ratio |
| cover | Content will fit the container and keep its aspec ratio but leaves no white space; it will crop the image if necessary |
| none | Content is not resized |
| scale-down | Content is sized like none or contain to keep a smaller concrete size |

## Implementation

Create your two `HTML` and `CSS` files and copy/paste the content from the last lesson into your respective locations. We will simply add another property to our existing content.

If you run your code, you should see this again:

Next, in your `CSS` file, in your `#picture` selector, add the property `object-fit` and set it to `cover`.  


You should now see this:

Again, screenshots wont quite do it justice but what you should see is that the picture is now the size you want and no longer squished! Awesome!
