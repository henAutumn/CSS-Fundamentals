# 7.6: Vertical-Align

The `vertical-align` property allows us to adjust where an element is situated in a container. This is particularly helpful when you are trying to push something to the top of a box, or center vertically in a `div`, etc.

## Vertical-Align Options

These are the options available for `vertical-align`:  


| Vertical-Align Values | Descriptions |
| :--- | :--- |
| baseline | Element is aligned with the baseline of its parent \(**this is the default**\) |
| length units | Raises or lowers element by specific length \(all `CSS` units work for this property\) |
| % | Raises or lowers element by percentage |
| sub | Element is aligned with the subscript baseline of its parent |
| super | Element is aligned with the superscript baseline of its parent |
| top | Element is aligned with the top of its tallest element on the line |
| text-top | Element is aligned with the top of its parent's font |
| middle | Element is aligned with the middle of its parent |
| bottom | Element is aligned with the lowest element on the line |
| text-bottom | Element is aligned with the bottom of its parent's font |

## Implementation

Create your two `HTML` and `CSS` files. In your `HTML` file, add the following:  


```markup
<div>
  <p>This <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1514984879728-be0aff75a6e8?ixlib=rb-0.3.5&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&s=35dcb9bb6f3e097541dd732a99c44766&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1576&q=80" alt="" height="300em"> is a cute puppy!</p>
</div>
```

Add the following to your `CSS` file,:  


```css
p {
  font-size: xx-large;
  text-align: center;
}
```

If you run your code, you will see this:

Now, for the `img` tag as a separate selector in your `CSS` file, alternate between the `vertical-align` of `text-bottom`, `text-top`, `middle`, and `super`. See the differences in where the picture is positioned! Experiement with the other values as well and see the subtle changes in your styling!
