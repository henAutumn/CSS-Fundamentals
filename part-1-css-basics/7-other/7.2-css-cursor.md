# 7.2: Cursor

How many times has we been on a site where we have not known if we are able to click on something because the simple cursor change was not there? How obnoxious can it be to have to click on a button when the cursor is nothing more than an arrow, or worse, the text cursor.  


`CSS` has saved the day once again! The `cursor` property now allows us to change the cursor to a litany of options to help our clients to know what is going on.  


The `cursor` property defaults to operate when your cursor is hovering over an element.

## Cursor Options

These are the options available for `cursor`:  


| Cursor Values | Descriptions |
| :--- | :--- |
| alias | The cursor indicates an alias of something is to be created |
| all-scroll | The cursor indicates that something can be scrolled in any direction |
| auto | The browser indicates what cursor will be used |
| cell | The cursor indicates that a cell \(or a set of cells\) may be selected |
| context-menu | The cursor indicates that the context-menu is available |
| col-resize | The cursor indicates that the column can be resized horizontally |
| copy | The cursor indicates that something can be copied |
| crosshair | The cursor renders a crosshair |
| default | This is the default cursor |
| e-resize | The cursor indicates that an edge of a box can be moved right \(east\)\* |
| ew-resize | The cursor indicates a bidirectional resize cursor \(east to west\) |
| grab | The cursor indicates that something can be grabbed |
| grabbing | The cursor indicates that is currently being grabbed |
| help | The cursor indicates that help is available |
| move | The cursor indicates that something can be moved |
| n-resize | The cursor indicates that an edge of a box can be moved north |
| ne-resize | The cursor indicates that an edge of a box can be moved northeast |
| nesw-resize | The cursor indicates a resizing in any direction |
| ns-resize | The cursor indicates a resizing vertical |
| nw-resize | The cursor indicates that an edge of a box can be moved northwest |
| nwse-resize | The cursor indicates a resizing in any direction |
| no-drop | The cursor indicates that the dragged item cannot be dropped here |
| none | No cursor is rendered |
| not-allowed | The cursor indicates that the requested action cannot be executed |
| pointer | The cursor is a pointed finger and indicates a link |
| progress | The cursor indicates that the progress is busy |
| row-resize | The cursor indicates that the row can be resized vertically |
| s-resize | The cursor indicates that an edge of a box can be moved south |
| se-resize | The cursor indicates that an edge of a box can be moved southeast |
| sw-resize | The cursor indicates that an edge of a box can be moved southwest |
| text | The cursor indicates text that can selected |
| URL | A comma-separated list of URLs to custom cursor. **NOTE**: always select a fallback cursor in case the URL fails |
| vertical-text | The cursor indicates the vertical text that can be selected |
| w-resize | The cursor indicates an edge of a box can be moved west |
| wait | The cursor indicates that the program is busy |
| zoom-in | The cursor indicates that something can be zoomed in |
| zoom-out | The cursor indicates that something can be zoomed out |

\*You might have noticed that the directions are less top, right, bottom, left; but north, east, south, and west. The developers of this property set the directions similar to that of a compass on a map.

## Implementation

Create your two `HTML` and `CSS` files. In your `HTML` file, add the following:  


```markup
<div>
  <p class="alias">alias</p>
  <p class="all-scroll">all-scroll</p>
  <p class="auto">auto</p>
  <p class="cell">cell</p>
  <p class="context-menu">context-menu</p>
  <p class="col-resize">col-resize</p>
  <p class="copy">copy</p>
  <p class="crosshair">crosshair</p>
  <p class="default">default</p>
  <p class="e-resize">e-resize</p>
  <p class="ew-resize">ew-resize</p>
  <p class="grab">grab</p>
  <p class="grabbing">grabbing</p>
  <p class="help">help</p>
  <p class="move">move</p>
  <p class="n-resize">n-resize</p>
  <p class="ne-resize">ne-resize</p>
  <p class="nesw-resize">nesw-resize</p>
  <p class="ns-resize">ns-resize</p>
  <p class="nw-resize">nw-resize</p>
  <p class="nwse-resize">nwse-resize</p>
  <p class="no-drop">no-drop</p>
  <p class="none">none</p>
  <p class="not-allowed">not-allowed</p>
  <p class="pointer">pointer</p>
  <p class="progress">progress</p>
  <p class="row-resize">row-resize</p>
  <p class="s-resize">s-resize</p>
  <p class="se-resize">se-resize</p>
  <p class="sw-resize">sw-resize</p>
  <p class="text">text</p>
  <p class="w-resize">w-resize</p>
  <p class="wait">wait</p>
  <p class="zoom-in">zoom-in</p>
  <p class="zoom-out">zoom-out</p>
</div>
```

Add the following to your `CSS` file:  


```css
.alias {cursor: alias;}
.all-scroll {cursor: all-scroll;}
.auto {cursor: auto;}
.cell {cursor: cell;}
.context-menu {cursor: context-menu;}
.col-resize {cursor: col-resize;}
.copy {cursor: copy;}
.crosshair {cursor: crosshair;}
.default {cursor: default;}
.e-resize {cursor: e-resize;}
.ew-resize {cursor: ew-resize;}
.grab {cursor: -webkit-grab; cursor: grab;}
.grabbing {cursor: -webkit-grabbing; cursor: grabbing;}
.help {cursor: help;}
.move {cursor: move;}
.n-resize {cursor: n-resize;}
.ne-resize {cursor: ne-resize;}
.nesw-resize {cursor: nesw-resize;}
.ns-resize {cursor: ns-resize;}
.nw-resize {cursor: nw-resize;}
.nwse-resize {cursor: nwse-resize;}
.no-drop {cursor: no-drop;}
.none {cursor: none;}
.not-allowed {cursor: not-allowed;}
.pointer {cursor: pointer;}
.progress {cursor: progress;}
.row-resize {cursor: row-resize;}
.s-resize {cursor: s-resize;}
.se-resize {cursor: se-resize;}
.sw-resize {cursor: sw-resize;}
.text {cursor: text;}
.w-resize {cursor: w-resize;}
.wait {cursor: wait;}
.zoom-in {cursor: zoom-in;}
.zoom-out {cursor: zoom-out;}
```

If you run your code, you will see list list we created and, on hovering over each of them, you will be able to see the options `cursor` provides!
