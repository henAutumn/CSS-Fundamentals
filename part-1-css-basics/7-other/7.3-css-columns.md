# 7.3: Columns

Regardless of how much content we may have, it is occasionally nice to determine how many columns we might need.  


Like many properties of `CSS`, `columns` \(and, yes, it is plural\) is a mixture of two different properties: `column-width` and `column-count`. This is pretty intuitive, however, in that we are then able, with the use of only `columns`, to set how many columns we want, as well as the width of each column.  


`Column-width` takes any of the `CSS` units of size \(1.2\), as well as `auto`.  


`Column-count`, likewise, can be set to `auto`, but can also take the number of columns you want to use.  


Incorporating both of these properties in one, `columns` would look something like: `columns: 100px 3;`.

## Implementation

Create your two `HTML` and `CSS` files. In your `HTML` file, add the following:  


```markup
<div id="columns">
  <p>Steamed coffee robust est, robusta, medium brewed at and, iced black galão caramelization iced dripper seasonal grounds robusta ristretto. Viennese lungo crema cup carajillo lungo, and, instant con panna, body, doppio macchiato, foam wings, flavour, steamed that kopi-luwak cup whipped.

Here, we have 5 `p` tags with a new variant of our lorem ipsum, [Coffee Ipsum](http://coffeeipsum.com/).  


In your `CSS` file, set your `id` of `columns` to take 5 columns at `20em` wide, each.  


If you run your code, you will see this:

Notice that we have five columns of text! However, look at how the text is wrapping from one column to the next if it is too long and spills over. This property does not take different elements, like `p` tags, into account. Keep that in mind.
