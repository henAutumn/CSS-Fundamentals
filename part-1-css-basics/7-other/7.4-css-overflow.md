# 7.4: Overflow

What happens if you have a container that you are quite proud of and do not want to change in size and shape, but you simply have too much content to put in that box? Is there a way to contain the content without it spilling over or cutting it off? Is there a way to make you content look good in limited space?  


Well, considering we are asking these rhetorical questions here, the answer is obviously 'yes' and it is with the `overflow` property!  


This property specifies what would happen if the content spills over the container it is in. However, it only works if the container has a specified `height` value.

## Overflow Options

These are the options available for `overflow`:  


| Overflow Values | Descriptions |
| :--- | :--- |
| visible | Overflow is not clipped; content renders outside of the container \(**this is the default**\) |
| hidden | Overflow is clipped; overflowing content is hidden |
| scroll | Overflow is clipped, but a scroll-bar is added to see the remainder of the content \(both x and y axis\) |
| auto | If overflow is clipped, a scroll-bar is added to see the remainder of the content \(for the only axis that spills over\) |

## Implementation

Create your two `HTML` and `CSS` files. In your `HTML` file, add the following:  


```markup
<div class="container">
  <p>The dog smells bad give attitude. Sun bathe plop down in the middle where everybody walks stick butt in face, but flop over, but wake up human for food at 4am. Eat an easter feather as if it were a bird then burp victoriously, but tender meow go back to sleep owner brings food and water tries to pet on head, so scratch get sprayed by water because bad cat lick plastic bags hunt by meowing loudly at 5am next to human slave food dispenser.

Here, we are pulling from [Cat Ipsum](http://www.catipsum.com/).  


Add the following to your `CSS` file,:  


```css
.container {
  background: lightblue;
  margin: auto;
  margin-top: 10em;
  max-width: 15em;
  max-height: 15em;
}
```

If you run your code, you will see this:

Now, add the `overflow` property and experiement with each of the values. See how they differ!
