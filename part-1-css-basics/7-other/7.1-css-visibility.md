# 7.1: Visibility

The `visibility` property is a simple one; it determines whether the element is visible or hidden.

## Visibility Options

These are the options available for `visibility`:  


| Visibility Values | Descriptions |
| :--- | :--- |
| visible | The element is visibility \(**this is the default**\) |
| hidden | The element is hidden but still takes up space |
| collapse | \(For tables only; `<tr>`, `<tbody>`, `<col>`, `<colgroup>`\) Removes a row or column, but does not affect the table layout |

## Implementation

Create your two `HTML` and `CSS` files. In your `HTML` file, add 5 `<button>` tags with `BUTTON` between the tags \(so each button will say "BUTTON"\), and 5 `<a>` tags that say `LINK`.  


Add the following to your `CSS` file:  


```css
a:active {
  visibility: hidden;
}

button:hover {
  visibility: hidden;
}
```

If you run your code, you will see the buttons and links lined up along the top of your screen. If you hover over the buttons, they will become invisibile; if you click the links, they, too, will become hidden.

## CSS Selectors

What is with those colons \(:\)?  


`CSS` selectors take in more than simply `classes` and `ids`. Knowing this will allow us to further customize our site with ease.
