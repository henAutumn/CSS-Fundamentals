# 2.5: Background Attachment

Again, create your two new files and copy-paste both `HTML` and `CSS` files from the previous lesson to this one.  


What is `background-attachment`? Does this...attach...something to our background? Well, no. This is an oddly-named property. `Background-attachment` does nothing more than decide if you want to have your background image scroll with you or stay in one place as you scroll up and down.  


With this amount of content, you should be able to scroll up and down. Notice how the image scrolls with you? This is the default setup for `background-attachment`. However, there are times when you want the background image to stay put and have everything else scroll over that static image.  


There are three options for `background-attachment`: `scroll`, `fixed`, and `local`. `Scroll` is default and simply allows us to scroll the image wit us. If we set `background-attachment` to `fixed`, the image is fixed in position as you scroll. `Local` allows us to scroll only within a localized container \(this feature is not heavily used\).

## Implementation and Practice

Go ahead and add the following to your `CSS` file: `background-attachment: scroll;`. When you run your code, it should look the same. What happens when you set `background-attachment` to `fixed`?
