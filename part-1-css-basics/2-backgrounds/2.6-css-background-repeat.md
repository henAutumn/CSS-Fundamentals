# 2.6: Background Repeat

What does `background-repeat` do? Unsurprisingly, it repeats your background image; this allows us to have that tiled effect, to have a single image.  


These are the options for `background-repeat`:  


| Repeat Values | Descriptions |
| :--- | :--- |
| repeat | Background image is repeated both vertically and horizontally \(**This is the default**\) |
| repeat-x | Background image is repeated only horizontally |
| repeat-y | Background image is repeated only vertically |
| no-repeat | Background image is not repeated |
| space | Background image is repeated as much as possible without clipping. The first and last images are pinned to either side of the element, and whitespace is distributed evenly between the images |
| round | Background image is repeated and squished or stretched to fill the space \(no gaps\) |

## Implementation Challenge

You are going to tackle this property on your own. Set up your files and run through all the options of `background-repeat` without any guidance \(**TIP**: try to set `background-position` to `center center` so you can see `background-repeat` clearly\).
