# 2.4: Background Position

As before, create your two files and copy-paste the existing `HTML` content into your newly created file \(again, be sure to change your link to the new `CSS` file\).  


In order to move background images around, we use `background-position`. Options for `background-position` are as follows:  


| Position Values | Descriptions |
| :--- | :--- |
| left top | Set the image to the top-left corner \(**If only one value specified, the other defaults at center**\) |
| left center | Set the image to the center-left side \(**If only one value specified, the other defaults at center**\) |
| left bottom | Set the image to the bottom-left corner \(**If only one value specified, the other defaults at center**\) |
| right top | Set the image to the top-right corner \(**If only one value specified, the other defaults at center**\) |
| right center | Set the image to the center-right side \(**If only one value specified, the other defaults at center**\) |
| right bottom | Set the image to the bottom-right corner \(**If only one value specified, the other defaults at center**\) |
| center top | Set the image to the top-center side \(**If only one value specified, the other defaults at center**\) |
| center center | Set the image to the center of the container \(**If only one value specified, the other defaults at center**\) |
| center bottom | Set the image to the bottom-center side \(**If only one value specified, the other defaults at center**\) |
| x% y% | X-axis and Y-axis position based on percentage |
| xpos ypos | X-axis and Y-axis position based on any CSS unit |

**NOTE**: With the pre-established locations, you can either put X-axis first or last \(`top right` or `right top`\); it does not matter.

## Implementation

Copy your `CSS` file from the previous lesson and paste it in this lesson's file. Then add this: `background-position: left top;`. Now change the position from `left top` to `bottom right`. You should see these \(look closely; the differences are subtle\):

Bottom Right

## Practice

Try your hand at moving the background image around with both pre-established locations \(i.e. `top left`\), `x% y%`, and `xpos ypos`.
