# 2.0: Background Overview

We are now able to manipulate fonts with `CSS`! Already, there has been a lot of information thrown your way. Take comfort in the fact that a lot of basics have been filtered in as you walked through the first module; many of these basics will carry through your future work.  


Where changing your font is a basic manipulation of your `HTML`, the second most-impactful styling will be in changing the white background to something more interesting.  


This module will walk you through manipulating the background of your `HTML`.

## Structure of Background Module

Your folder structure for this module should look like this \(notice: for each `HTML` file, you are adding a `CSS` file with the same name\):  


```text
    └── css-fundamentals
        └── 1-css-fonts
        └── 2-css-backgrounds
            └── 2.1-background-color.css
            └── 2.1-background-color.html
            └── 2.2-background-image.css
            └── 2.2-background-image.html
            └── 2.3-background-size.css
            └── 2.3-background-size.html
            └── 2.4-background-position.css
            └── 2.4-background-position.html
            └── 2.5-background-attachment.css
            └── 2.5-background-attachment.html
            └── 2.6-background-repeat.css
            └── 2.6-background-repeat.html
```
