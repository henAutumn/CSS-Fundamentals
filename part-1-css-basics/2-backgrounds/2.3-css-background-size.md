# 2.3: Background Size

We are now able to see an image in our background! However, what if the size is all wrong? In some cases, the image will be too small and not fill the desired space; in other cases, it will be far too big and only show a piece of it in the locatino we are trying to fill. How can we adjust this? `Background-size` does just this!  


As we did with the last lesson, create both `HTML` and `CSS` files, copy and paste the content from you `HTML` file in the last lesson and paste it in you `HTML` file for this one \(be sure to change the link to you newly created `CSS` file\).  


## Options for Background-Size

As with **font-size** \(1.2\), the `relative and absolute length units` are all available. However, considering that `background-size` is used to allow for better responsive design \(to allow it to look nice on any device\), let's gravitate toward relative length units; let's use `em` values in our sizing.  


Now, in your `CSS` file, add the following code:  


```css
#backgroundImage {
  /* The same code as the previous lesson */
  background-image: url("https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1523612192437-66de9804ac3c?ixlib=rb-0.3.5&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&s=59310f54610ead00fcc3d07732d5d473&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1950&q=80");
  /* New code added below */
  background-size: 30em;
}
```

When you run the code, you should see this:

Admittedly, it is hard to see the text, however, you should now be able to see tiles of the background image. Why is it doing this, instead of just one small picture in the middle with a lot of white space around it?  


The default for background images is to fill the space, no matter what. So, if the picture is too small to fill the space, it will repeat itself, creating a tile structure of the same picture.  


## Cover

There is another option for sizing background images--the `cover` value. This sets the image to fit the screen entirely. If the container is bigger than the image, `cover` will stretch the image to fit accordingly; if it is smaller, it will shave pieces of the image off so it can fit the space. This is a great tool for a full background image, but not particularly helpful in a long, thin container.

## Practice

The concept is rather straight-forward. However, there are a lot of possibilities in sizing with this property.  


Try you hand at utilizing different length units and see how it affects your background image.

## Challenge

Try to set the background-size to fit your browser window. Try this, using two relative length units and two absolute length units.

Now, let's see how to move the position of the picture around!
