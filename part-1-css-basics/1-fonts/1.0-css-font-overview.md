# 1.0: Font Overview

At its most-basic, `CSS` offers a way to stylize font \(and other features\) that is built in through `HTML`; it is the ultimate complement to the `HTML` scaffolding. As a default, `HTML` creates black-on-white, Times New Roman text.  


So, as we build up our skills of `CSS`, let's start at the beginning--adjusting the font that comes from `HTML`. This first module will look at various ways to stylize font, ranging from the `font` itself, to `color`, `bold`, `italics`, `underline`, `capitalization`, and so on.  


And, as stated before, when walking through this series, the **BEST** way to learn `CSS` is to experiment and innovate! Change and create new things as we go; this will only help you see the breadth, and limitations, of `CSS`.

## Structure of Font Module

As you work through this module, you will build out your own files. Your folder structure should look like this:  


```text
    └── css-fundamentals
        └── 1-css-fonts
            └── 1.1-font-family.html
            └── 1.2-font-size.html
            └── 1.3-font-weight.html
            └── 1.4-font-style.html
            └── 1.5-color.html
            └── 1.6-text-decoration.html
            └── 1.7-text-transform.html
            └── 1.8-text-shadow.html
```

## Plan of Attack

You might have noticed that you are only creating `HTML` files. In addition to learning these property values, but you will also learn how to integrate `CSS` into your `HTML` in various ways. And, in doing so, you will also see how `CSS` is prioritized \(we will get to that a bit later on\).  


Let's get started!
