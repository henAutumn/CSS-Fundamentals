# 3.0: Border Overview

Where `HTML`, at its most-basic, is black, serif text on a white background, we have learned how to style both text and background with `CSS` in the two previous modules. Nice!  


There is, however, much more that we can accomplish with `CSS`! This module helps us...wrap...our head around bordering a container so we can see the outline.  


If you want a box for your text, we will learn how to do that! We will be able to frame a picture or make circular images. So, let's take a look at borders with `CSS`!

## Structure of Border Module

Your folder structure for this module should look like this:  


```text
    └── css-fundamentals
        └── 1-css-fonts
        └── 2-css-backgrounds
        └── 3-css-borders
            └── 3.1-border-style.css
            └── 3.1-border-style.html
            └── 3.2-border-width.css
            └── 3.2-border-width.html
            └── 3.3-border-color.css
            └── 3.3-border-color.html
            └── 3.4-border-radius.css
            └── 3.4-border-radius.html
            └── 3.5-outline.css
            └── 3.5-outline.html
```
