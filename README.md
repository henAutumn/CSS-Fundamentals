## CSS Fundamentals

Welcome to an introduction to Cascading Style Sheets, or CSS. This GitBook will walk through the basics of CSS in a structured and intuitive way, allowing a holistic understanding of this programming language. Though it is not exhaustive, the material in this book will provide a wide-spanned view of this front end language through both lessons and lists of options for any given element, as well as interactive walk throughs so that you can work with and experience these elements on your own.

### We are excited

We are pumped!!!

We hope you have a lot of fun with the implementations within this application that will help you build your bigger application.

### Feedback:

We are constantly improving our curriculum and materials, so there may be some material in this book that you are the first to use in the classroom. We have tested the code, read through it, vetted resources, and retested it. But we know there may still be typos and bugs.

Please use the following guidelines for feedback:

_typos_: If you see a typo, you don't have to scream it from the rooftop. Just slack one of your instructors, preferably Carolyn. Give us the Part \#, module number and approximate location, please.

_bugs_: If you think you've found a bug, let an instructor know.

_suggestions_: Send Paul a note if you have good ideas or ways that this could be improved.
